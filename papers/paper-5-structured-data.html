            <div class="abstract-label">Abstract</div>
            <p>This paper argues that structured data-specifically JSON-LD schema markup-provides value for political campaigns independent of AI company cooperation. Drawing on research demonstrating 3x accuracy improvements when LLMs use knowledge graphs, it presents the case for building structured data infrastructure now rather than waiting for AI company partnerships. The paper also examines existing precedents, including OpenAI's product feed system, and proposes analogous standards for political content.</p>
        </div>

        <h2><span class="section-number">I.</span> The Infrastructure Question</h2>

        <p>Previous papers in this series have established that AI systems are becoming important information intermediaries (<a href="paper-2-gatekeeper.html">Paper II</a>), that they cannot be politically neutral (<a href="paper-4-neutrality.html">Paper IV</a>), and that their training creates structural patterns favoring evidence-based communication (<a href="paper-3-structural-alignment.html">Paper III</a>). The strategic question remains: what should campaigns actually do?</p>

        <p>One answer is to seek partnerships with AI companies-negotiate for fair treatment, advocate for transparent political content handling, or invest in influencing training data. These approaches require AI company cooperation and face significant obstacles (see <a href="paper-6-technical-pathways.html">Paper VI</a>).</p>

        <p>This paper advances an alternative: structured data infrastructure that provides value regardless of AI company policies. <span class="highlight">The core insight is that JSON-LD schema markup improves AI accuracy through mechanisms that operate independent of intentional cooperation.</span> Campaigns that implement structured data will be represented more accurately whether or not AI companies want this to happen.</p>

        <h2><span class="section-number">II.</span> The Knowledge Graph Accuracy Effect</h2>

        <h3>A. The data.world Benchmark</h3>

        <p>The most direct evidence for structured data's value comes from a benchmark study conducted by the data.world AI Lab. Juan Sequeda, Dean Allemang, and Bryon Jacob tested LLM accuracy on enterprise question-answering tasks with and without knowledge graph support.<sup class="fn-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fn1-ref">1</a></sup></p>

        <p>The study used an enterprise SQL database schema from the insurance industry, containing 13 complex tables covering policies, claims, coverages, and relationships. Researchers posed 43 business questions of varying complexity and measured whether GPT-4 could generate correct answers.</p>

        <h4>Key Findings</h4>

        <p><strong>Without Knowledge Graph:</strong> LLM accuracy was 16.7%. The system frequently failed on complex queries requiring understanding of table relationships and business context.<sup class="fn-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fn2-ref">2</a></sup></p>

        <p><strong>With Knowledge Graph:</strong> LLM accuracy increased to 54.2%-<span class="highlight">a <strong>3x improvement</strong></span>.<sup class="fn-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fn3-ref">3</a></sup></p>

        <p><strong>Schema-Intensive Questions:</strong> For questions focused on metrics, KPIs, and strategic planning-questions requiring deep understanding of data relationships-accuracy without a knowledge graph was <strong>0%</strong>. The LLM simply could not answer these questions without structured context.<sup class="fn-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fn4-ref">4</a></sup></p>

        <div class="callout callout-evidence">
            <div class="callout-label">Evidence Classification: Proven</div>
            <p>The 3x accuracy improvement from knowledge graphs is demonstrated by peer-reviewed research using controlled experiments and published methodology. The finding has been cited and validated by subsequent research.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>B. Follow-Up Research</h3>

        <p>A 2024 follow-up study by Allemang and Sequeda demonstrated additional accuracy improvements through ontology-based query validation. By leveraging the semantic structure of the knowledge graph to detect and repair incorrect queries, accuracy increased further to 72%.<sup class="fn-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fn5-ref">5</a></sup></p>

        <p>This suggests that the knowledge graph effect compounds: not only does structured data help LLMs generate better initial answers, but it also enables validation and correction mechanisms that catch errors.</p>

        <h3>C. Industry Confirmation</h3>

        <p>Major technology companies have confirmed that structured data improves AI understanding:</p>

        <p><strong>Microsoft/Bing:</strong> At SMX Munich in March 2025, Fabrice Canel stated that "schema markup helps Microsoft's LLMs understand content."<sup class="fn-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fn6-ref">6</a></sup></p>

        <p><strong>Google:</strong> Ryan Levering of Google Search Central confirmed that schema plays a role in grounding generative AI.<sup class="fn-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fn7-ref">7</a></sup></p>

        <p><strong>Gartner:</strong> Named knowledge graphs a "critical emerging technology" for AI applications in February 2024.<sup class="fn-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fn8-ref">8</a></sup></p>

        <div class="callout callout-limitation">
            <div class="callout-label">Limitation</div>
            <p>The data.world research was conducted on enterprise SQL databases, not political content. Applying these findings to political campaigns involves analogical reasoning: we are asserting that the mechanisms that improve accuracy for business questions will also improve accuracy for political questions. This is plausible but not directly demonstrated.</p>
        </div>

        <h2><span class="section-number">III.</span> Why Structured Data Works Without Cooperation</h2>

        <h3>A. The Web Crawling Mechanism</h3>

        <p>AI systems already crawl the web for training data and real-time retrieval. They already prefer structured over unstructured data when available-structured data is easier to parse, less ambiguous, and more reliable. This behavior exists independent of any partnership or cooperation.</p>

        <p>When a campaign publishes JSON-LD schema markup on their website:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>AI crawlers encounter the structured data during normal web indexing</li>
            <li>The system extracts clean, machine-readable facts (candidate name, office sought, policy positions)</li>
            <li>When users ask about the candidate, the system has higher-quality source material to draw from</li>
            <li>Responses are more accurate because the underlying data is better structured</li>
        </ol>

        <p>No AI company decision is required. The improvement happens through existing technical mechanisms.</p>

        <h3>B. The Standards Advantage</h3>

        <p>JSON-LD builds on Schema.org, a vocabulary created in 2011 through collaboration among Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, and Yandex. The standard has been in use for over a decade and is deployed across millions of websites.<sup class="fn-ref"><a href="#fn9" id="fn9-ref">9</a></sup></p>

        <p>This means:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Platform-agnostic:</strong> The same markup works for Google, Bing, ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and any future AI system</li>
            <li><strong>Standards-based:</strong> Not dependent on any single company's goodwill</li>
            <li><strong>Proven technology:</strong> Well-understood implementation with extensive documentation</li>
        </ul>

        <h2><span class="section-number">IV.</span> The E-Commerce Precedent</h2>

        <h3>A. OpenAI's Agentic Commerce Protocol</h3>

        <p>In 2025, OpenAI launched a structured product feed system allowing merchants to submit catalog data directly to ChatGPT for shopping experiences.<sup class="fn-ref"><a href="#fn10" id="fn10-ref">10</a></sup> Key characteristics:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Merchant-provided source of truth:</strong> OpenAI relies on merchant feeds for accurate pricing and availability</li>
            <li><strong>High-frequency updates:</strong> Feeds accepted every 15 minutes</li>
            <li><strong>Push model:</strong> Merchants submit structured files rather than waiting for crawling</li>
            <li><strong>Designed for reasoning:</strong> Data structured for AI interpretation, not just indexing</li>
        </ul>

        <p>One industry analysis observed: "Google built its product feed for indexing. OpenAI built theirs for reasoning. One tells a search engine what you sell. The other helps an AI explain <em>why</em> it matters."<sup class="fn-ref"><a href="#fn11" id="fn11-ref">11</a></sup></p>

        <h3>B. The Political Content Parallel</h3>

        <p>A political information feed following the e-commerce model could allow campaigns to submit structured position data directly to AI systems. Such a system would enable:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Accurate representation:</strong> AI responses would draw from verified campaign-provided information</li>
            <li><strong>Real-time updates:</strong> Position changes would propagate within hours, not weeks</li>
            <li><strong>Evidence linking:</strong> Claims could include structured citations to supporting sources</li>
            <li><strong>Comparison capability:</strong> Standardized formats would enable accurate cross-candidate comparisons</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="callout callout-warning">
            <div class="callout-label">Evidence Classification: Proposed</div>
            <p>No AI company has announced plans to create political content feeds. This section describes what <em>could</em> be built based on existing e-commerce precedents, not what <em>will</em> be built. The proposal is the author's recommendation.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>C. Other Precedents</h3>

        <p><strong>ClaimReview Schema:</strong> Fact-checking organizations use the ClaimReview schema standard to mark up fact-checks in ways that search engines and AI systems can parse. The system enables claims to be matched with corrections automatically.<sup class="fn-ref"><a href="#fn12" id="fn12-ref">12</a></sup></p>

        <p><strong>Google Civic Information API:</strong> The Voting Information Project-a partnership of state election officials, foundations, and technology companies-provides structured data about polling locations, candidate information, and election official data.<sup class="fn-ref"><a href="#fn13" id="fn13-ref">13</a></sup></p>

        <p>These examples demonstrate that structured data standards for political content are feasible and that collaborative development models exist.</p>

        <h2><span class="section-number">V.</span> What Political Schema Would Look Like</h2>

        <h3>A. Core Entity Types</h3>

        <p>A comprehensive political schema vocabulary would extend Schema.org to include:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>PoliticalCandidate:</strong> Person seeking elected office, with office sought, party affiliation, and campaign period</li>
            <li><strong>PolicyPosition:</strong> Candidate's stance on an issue, with evidence links and date stated</li>
            <li><strong>CampaignPledge:</strong> Specific commitment with conditions and timeline</li>
            <li><strong>VotingRecord:</strong> Documented legislative votes with context and explanation</li>
            <li><strong>Endorsement:</strong> Support from individuals or organizations with date and statement</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>B. Example Implementation</h3>

        <pre><code>&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Person",
  "name": "Jane Smith",
  "jobTitle": "State Senate Candidate",
  "affiliation": {
    "@type": "PoliticalParty",
    "name": "Democratic Party"
  },
  "seeks": {
    "@type": "Role",
    "roleName": "State Senator",
    "location": "District 15"
  },
  "knowsAbout": [
    {
      "@type": "PolicyPosition",
      "about": "Healthcare Access",
      "position": "Supports Medicaid expansion",
      "datePublished": "2024-03-15",
      "citation": "https://janesmith.com/healthcare"
    }
  ]
}
&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>

        <p>This structured data would be invisible to human visitors but fully accessible to AI crawlers, enabling accurate extraction of candidate information.</p>

        <h2><span class="section-number">VI.</span> Strategic Implications</h2>

        <h3>A. The Independence Argument</h3>

        <p>The central strategic advantage of structured data is that it works without requiring AI company cooperation. Unlike approaches that depend on partnerships, content moderation policies, or training data access, schema markup operates through existing technical mechanisms.</p>

        <p>This means:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>No approval needed:</strong> Campaigns can implement structured data unilaterally</li>
            <li><strong>No partnership risk:</strong> Effectiveness doesn't depend on maintaining AI company relationships</li>
            <li><strong>No policy vulnerability:</strong> Works even if AI companies change political content policies</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>B. The Foundation for Other Approaches</h3>

        <p>As <a href="paper-6-technical-pathways.html">Paper VI</a> demonstrates, all viable technical approaches to AI visibility require structured data infrastructure. If AI companies later open APIs, campaigns with structured data are ready. If political advertising becomes available in AI responses, structured data enables better targeting. If regulatory requirements mandate accuracy, structured data provides the source material.</p>

        <p>Investment in structured data creates optionality for futures that don't yet exist.</p>

        <h3>C. First-Mover Advantage</h3>

        <p>Organizations that build structured data infrastructure now gain several advantages:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Standards influence:</strong> Early adopters shape how political schema standards develop</li>
            <li><strong>Technical expertise:</strong> Building institutional knowledge before competitors</li>
            <li><strong>Network effects:</strong> More adoption creates stronger standards and better tooling</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The window for first-mover advantage will close as the technology becomes standard practice. The question is whether progressive organizations will lead or follow.</p>

        <h2><span class="section-number">VII.</span> Conclusion</h2>

        <p>Structured data provides value for political campaigns through mechanisms that operate independent of AI company policies:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Accuracy improvement:</strong> Knowledge graphs enable 3x accuracy improvements in LLM responses (demonstrated in enterprise contexts)</li>
            <li><strong>No cooperation required:</strong> Schema markup works through existing web crawling mechanisms</li>
            <li><strong>Standards-based:</strong> JSON-LD and Schema.org are platform-agnostic, proven technologies</li>
            <li><strong>Precedent exists:</strong> E-commerce product feeds demonstrate the model; political adaptation is feasible</li>
        </ol>

        <p>The strategic recommendation is clear: campaigns should invest in structured data infrastructure now, regardless of uncertainty about AI company behavior, because the infrastructure provides value through mechanisms that don't require permission.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p><span class="highlight">"The investment in JSON-LD schema is foundational regardless of which pathway eventually opens. It is the one approach that cannot be wasted."</span></p>
