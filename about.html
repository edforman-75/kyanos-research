        <h2>The Author</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Ed Forman</strong> brings four decades of experience building companies around disruptive technologies to the challenge of AI-mediated political communication. His career spans the major technology transitions of the past 40 years: database software at Ingres, personal computing at Apple, wireless messaging at RadioMail, web development tools at Elemental Software, interactive television at ICTV and ActiveVideo Networks, and now AI commerce optimization at Glu.ai.</p>

        <p>Ed has been a founder, CEO, and senior executive at multiple venture-backed startups, with extensive experience in business planning, financial modeling, and strategic marketing for emerging technology markets. He holds an MBA from Stanford Graduate School of Business and has served on the Stanford GSB Executive Education teaching team since 2015, coaching corporate executives in design thinking, business model innovation, and strategic leadership.</p>

        <p>His international work includes coaching entrepreneurs through Stanford SEED in Ghana, Nigeria, and Ivory Coast; mentoring startups at Startup Chile; and teaching entrepreneurship at Africa Leadership University in Rwanda. He co-founded RahRah4Good, a social enterprise supporting African women through fashion accessories.</p>

        <p>Ed currently advises <a href="https://www.glu.ai/geo" target="_blank">Glu.ai</a>, an AI commerce optimization platform helping e-commerce merchants achieve visibility in the emerging "Answer Economy." The techniques for making product information discoverable by AI chatbots are directly analogous to what political campaigns need-which is why he sees this challenge so clearly.</p>

        <h2>KyanosTech</h2>

        <p><strong>KyanosTech</strong> ("Blue Technology") is a political technology company building AI optimization infrastructure for progressive campaigns and elected officials. The company's mission is ensuring that Democratic candidates, causes, and factual information are accurately discoverable by AI systems.</p>

        <p>The company offers three integrated products:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>AGON</strong> - Campaign AI optimization platform ("Win the Contest")</li>
            <li><strong>POLIS</strong> - Elected official website optimization ("Govern with Intelligence")</li>
            <li><strong>SCOPE</strong> - AI efficacy measurement and bias detection ("Measure What Matters")</li>
        </ul>

        <p>KyanosTech is seeking $5.2M in staged investment to reach break-even by 2028, targeting $6.4M in revenue across 360 campaign and officeholder customers. The company is structured as a Public Benefit Corporation to align investor returns with progressive political outcomes.</p>

        <h2>This Research</h2>

        <p>This monograph was produced by Ed Forman with substantial research and drafting assistance from Claude (Anthropic). The work represents a synthesis of academic research, industry analysis, and strategic thinking about AI's role in democratic information access.</p>

        <p>The author acknowledges a commercial interest in the conclusions of this research-KyanosTech's products implement the structured data approach recommended here. This interest is disclosed so readers can evaluate the analysis with appropriate context. The goal has been rigorous analysis despite this interest, with explicit acknowledgment of uncertainties and alternative interpretations.</p>

            <div class="callout-label">Limitations</div>
            <p>This research has limitations. Projections about AI adoption rates by 2028 range from 25-70% depending on platform policy evolution. The structured data effectiveness evidence comes primarily from enterprise contexts, not political content specifically. The strategic analysis reflects one perspective; reasonable observers may disagree with conclusions while accepting the underlying evidence.</p>
