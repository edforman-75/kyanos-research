            <p>This research monograph examines the emerging role of AI chatbots as gatekeepers of political information and argues for proactive infrastructure investment by progressive campaigns and organizations. The work is organized as a series of papers, each addressing a distinct question while contributing to a unified argument. All claims are documented with citations to primary sources.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
        
        <p>By 2028, <span class="highlight">a substantial portion of American voters will use AI chatbots-ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Google's AI Overviews-as their primary tool for researching political candidates and issues</span>. This represents a fundamental shift in how political information reaches voters, comparable in magnitude to the rise of talk radio in the 1990s or social media in the 2010s.</p>

        <p>This shift creates both risks and opportunities. The risks are documented: <span class="highlight">AI systems can measurably influence political views</span>, they exhibit structural patterns that advantage some communication styles over others, and they face unprecedented pressures from partisan actors seeking to shape their outputs. The opportunities are equally significant: campaigns that invest in structured data infrastructure can ensure accurate representation regardless of platform biases, and evidence-based communication naturally aligns with how AI systems are trained.</p>

        <p>The central argument of this monograph is strategic: <span class="highlight">progressives face a choice between building AI optimization infrastructure now or ceding first-mover advantage to competitors</span>-repeating the pattern of talk radio and podcasts, where conservatives built infrastructure while progressives debated whether to engage.</p>
